#
# Build plugin.c, which contains the plugin version[] string, a
# function plugin_register() that calls the register routines for all
# protocols, and a function plugin_reg_handoff() that calls the handoff
# registration routines for all protocols.
#
# We do this by scanning sources.  If that turns out to be too slow,
# maybe we could just require every .o file to have an register routine
# of a given name (packet-aarp.o -> proto_register_aarp, etc.).
#
# Formatting conventions:  The name of the proto_register_* routines an
# proto_reg_handoff_* routines must start in column zero, or must be
# preceded only by "void " starting in column zero, and must not be
# inside #if.
#
# REGISTER_SRC_FILES is assumed to have all the files that need to be scanned.
#
# For some unknown reason, having a big "for" loop in the Makefile
# to scan all the files doesn't work with some "make"s; they seem to
# pass only the first few names in the list to the shell, for some
# reason.
#
# Therefore, we have a script to generate the plugin.c file.
# The shell script runs slowly, as multiple greps and seds are run
# for each input file; this is especially slow on Windows.  Therefore,
# if Python is present (as indicated by PYTHON being defined), we run
# a faster Python script to do that work instead.
#
# The first argument is the directory in which the source files live.
# The second argument is "plugin", to indicate that we should build
# a plugin.c file for a plugin.
# All subsequent arguments are the files to scan.
