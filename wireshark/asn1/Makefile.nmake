# Logic;
# 1. If this Makefile is invoked w/o a target:
#    Do default target 'all' which invokes the Makefile.nmake
#     in each individual ASN1 sub-directory using the value of ASN1_MAKE_TARGET
#     as the make target.
#    (If ASN1_MAKE_TARGET is not defined then default to "all"
#     which generates the individual ASN1 dissector files into
#     epan\dissectors).
#
# 2. If this Makefile is invoked with one of the following targets, then do the action for the target:
#    Reinvoke this Makefile with 'all' as target and with ASN1_MAKE_TARGET
#     defined as appropriate.
#       clean
#       copy_files           : generate the dissectors into epan\dissectors
#                            :  (This is, in effect, the same as invoking this makefile w/o a target).
