 * tvbuffs: dissector use and management
 *
 *  Consider a collection of tvbs as being a chain or stack of tvbs.
 *
 *  When dissecting a frame:
 *   The top-level dissector (packet.c) pushes the initial tvb (containing
 *   the complete frame) onto the stack (starts the chain) and then calls
 *   a sub-dissector which in turn calls the next sub-dissector and so on.
 *   Each sub-dissector may chain additional tvbs (see below) to the tvb
 *   handed to that dissector. After dissection is complete and control has
 *   returned to the top-level dissector, the chain of tvbs (stack) is free'd
 *   via a call to tvb_free_chain() (in epan_dissect_cleanup()).
 *
 * A dissector:
 *  - Can chain new tvbs (subset, real, composite) to the
 *    tvb handed to the dissector using tvb_new_subset(),
 *    tvb_new_subset_length(), tvb_new_subset_remaining(),
 *    tvb_new_child_real_data(), tvb_set_child_real_data_tvbuff(),
 *    tvb_composite_finalize(), and tvb_child_uncompress(). (Composite
 *    tvbs should reference only tvbs which are already part of the chain).
 *  - Must not save for later use (e.g., when dissecting another frame) a
 *    pointer to a tvb handed to the dissector; (A higher level function
 *    may very well free the chain thus leaving a dangling pointer).
 *    This (obviously) also applies to any tvbs chained to the tvb handed
 *    to the dissector.
 *  - Can create its own tvb chain (using tvb_new_real_data() which the
 *    dissector is free to manage as desired. */
