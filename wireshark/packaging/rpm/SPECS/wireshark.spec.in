%description
Wireshark is a free network protocol analyzer for Unix and Windows. It
allows you to examine data from a live network or from a capture file
on disk. You can interactively browse the capture data, viewing summary
and detail information for each packet. Wireshark has several powerful
features, including a rich display filter language and the ability to
view the reconstructed stream of a TCP session.

This package contains command-line utilities, plugins, and documentation for
Wireshark. A GTK+ graphical user interface is packaged separately.

%description gnome
Contains the Gnome (GTK+) Wireshark GUI and desktop integration files.

%changelog
* Thu Mar 28 2013 Jeff Morriss
- Simplify check for rpmbuild's version.

* Fri Mar  8 2013 Jeff Morriss
- Put all icons in hicolor
- Use SuSE's desktop-update macro.
- Actually update MIME database when Wireshark's prefix is not /usr .

* Thu Mar  6 2013 Jeff Morriss
- List more build dependencies.
- Update to work on SuSE too: some of their package names are different.

* Thu Mar  6 2013 Gerald Combs
- Enable c-ares by default

* Mon Feb  6 2013 Jeff Morriss
- Overhaul to make this file more useful/up to date.  Many changes are based
  on Fedora's .spec file.  Changes include:
  - Create a separate wireshark-gnome package (like Redhat).
  - Control some things with variables set at the top of the file.
    - Allow the user to configure how dumpcap is installed.
    - Allow the user to choose some options including GTK2 or GTK3.
  - Greatly expand the BuildRequires entries; get the minimum versions of some
    things from 'configure'.
  - Install freedesktop files for better (free)desktop integration.

* Thu Aug 10 2006 Joerg Mayer
- Starting with X.org 7.x X11R6 is being phased out. Install wireshark
  and manpage into the standard path.

* Mon Aug 01 2005 Gerald Combs
- Add a desktop file and icon for future use

- Take over the role of packager

- Update descriptions and source locations

* Thu Oct 28 2004 Joerg Mayer
- Add openssl requirement (heimdal and net-snmp are still automatic)

* Tue Jul 20 2004 Joerg Mayer
- Redo install and files section to actually work with normal builds

* Sat Feb 07 2004 Joerg Mayer
- in case there are shared libs: include them

* Tue Aug 24 1999 Gilbert Ramirez

  the version automatically
